    "* 4.1 - It wouldn't be appropriate to utilise semi-supervised machine learning algorithms. If most of the transactions in the dataset are already marked as either fraudulent or legitimate, it's better to use supervised learning. This is because there is enough labeled data to teach a model how to recognize these transactions properly.\n",
    "* 4.2 - A semi-supervised algorithm would be appropriate here as we have only a few surveys with satisfaction ratings and many more without any ratings, semi-supervised learning helps us use all that unlabeled survey data. This way, we can get a better idea of what makes a survey positive or negative and predict satisfaction ratings more accurately than if we only used the few surveys that already have ratings.\n",
    "* 4.3 - A semi-supervised algorithm isn't suited here. If the majority of emails in the dataset are already labeled (as spam or not spam), this situation is generally well-suited for supervised learning.\n",
    "* 4.4 - A supervised algorithm can be used as this method uses past data where we already know who didn't pay back. However, if we have a lot of extra data about people that doesn't say if they paid back or not, we might use a mix of both known and unknown data to make better guesses. Which means that a semi-supervised algorithm can also be used."
